# DiscordVirusScanner
An experiment to see if I could link the VirusTotal API up to a Discord bot to scan URLs.

## Limitations

- The bot struggles to scan certian URLs, the reason behind this isn't clear. It may be as a result of a bug in the API or an error encoding the URL.

- The bot can only scan up to 500 URLs a day using VirusTotal's free version of the API.
